The purpose is to compare Q1 Transacted Prices between 2023 and 2024.\nPlots are shown side by side, with same range in the y-axis, which makes it easy to compare the values between the 2 plots.\nUse of median reference line for each year to see how the prices for each property time compare with the overall median.\n\n\n\nPoints of Improvement\n\nDetails are lost in the scale. Most of the values are less than $10M but it is hard to see the price distribution lower than this value.\n\nDue to this, even if there is a median reference line, it is hard to see compare Apartment, Condominium, or Executive condo prices with this trend.\n\nNo enlightening title to tell the story of the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Points\n\nY-axis labels are easy to read, instead of the raw numbers, e.g.Â 40M vs 40000000.\nNo ticks on categorical axis (Property Type)\nEffort in using a theme for more professional look\n\n\n\nPoints of Improvement\n\nMedian labels cover the box plot.\nX-axis labels are vertical, which make them hard to read\nAxis texts are very close to the axis labels, making the plot look messy\nDifficult to compare the price difference for each property type\n\nThe reader needs context switching from the left to right graph to compare"

Using a bright color like blue for the 2024 plot and a muted color like gray for the 2023 plot places the focus towards the 2024 data during the comparison.\nThe theme and the styles applied greatly improved the readability, especially as the x-axis labels are now rendered horizontally. This also provided a bigger space for the plot itself.\nLastly, the title and subtitle provides a story for the visualization to help the reader understand what is presented to them.\n\n\nWhile the makeover made the visualization more aesthetic, further improvements can be made:\n\nFree up more space on the right by moving the legend to inside the plot. This will help expand the plot horizontally.\nAdjust the x-axis texts. The labels are small and may be challenging for readers to read. As Property Type is a core part of the visualization, the legibility must be improved.\nReference lines are hard to see when overlapping with boxplots. It is hard to compare with the reference lines especially for Apartment and Condominium as the color of the reference lines are the same as the fill. Consider changing the color of the reference lines.\nAdd axis line and ticks to y-axis as it is a continuous value\nIf possible, add more values in y-axis labels as log scale is more difficult to judge than a linear scale. For example, we cannot see the values above $30M."

Doing this also ensures that no important information get covered by the annotations.\nNext, the colors of the reference lines were changed to a different color than the fills, with labels added to the end of the line so readers wonât need to refer to the legend to identify what the line is for.\nLastly, we did tweaks on the axis to improve legibility by increasing the font size. The y-axis now has smaller breaks to help readers gauge the log scale better. Aesthetically, this is worse as the axis labels do not look equidistant. However, this helps a lot in clarity.\n\n\nIn our subtitle, we have this excerpt from the original write-up:\n\nOverall prices have increased by 3.7% from $1.63M to $1.69M. However, the price variability for all property types have decreased, with fewer outliers present.\n\nNow that we expanded the y-axis, we can see that this is not necessarily true. The box and whiskers are longer in 2024 than 2023 for Condominium and Semi-Detached House. Hence, we must update this to prevent confusion.\nInstead, we can emphasize the observation that Landed properties all sold above the market median.\nLastly, the text size of our plot title and subtitles must be increased as well for legibility and make adjustments accordingly after we increased the font sizes in other parts of the plot."

Another added benefit of this is that property types whose prices are closer to the median are closer to the reference line labels, which makes it easier to do a closer comparison and referencing.\nWe also changed the focus of the subtitle from price variability, which was found to be misleading once we could see the price ranges more clearly.\nThis ends the makeover as we have already greatly improved the clarity and aesthetics."

With adjacent box plots, price comparisons from one year to the other became much easier.\nAdditionally, scaling the y-axis from linear to log improved clarity, especially as properties sold for a wide range of prices. We can observe that Semi-Detached Houses and Condominiums show increased variability in 2024Q1, as indicated by longer box and whiskers. This is contrary to the insights from the original visualization, which indicated that prices are less variable for all property types.\nFurthermore, annotations highlighted notable observations, such as all landed properties sold in 2024Q1 for higher than the market median. Additionally, the switch to a white background enhanced the overall aesthetic of the visualization. This allowed for more flexible styling compared to the originalâs light blue economist theme, providing a more visually appealing and informative representation of the data."

With the learning from this course, I was able to know what to look out for when looking at data presented (e.g.Â whatâs missing, what it really means, etc.)\nI also realized that although I was very detailed in my work for Take-home Exercise 1, I focused more on the aesthetics of the visualization more than the clarity as I enjoyed playing around with ggplot themes.\nThis exercise reminded me to balance the clarity with aesthetics and that data visualizations are for enlightenment, not entertaining."

    "text": "Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world at 89.7%, 2nd only to Russia among the G20 countries. Due to Singaporeâs successful public housing program, 77.8% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats, while 22% live in private properties like condos or landed properties.\nWhile the HDB market targets Singaporeans with household income of up to 14,000 SGD, the private housing market is Singapore is still in demand for households looking to upgrade, invest their property, and for residents not eligible for public housing (e.g.Â high income household, foreigners, etc.)\nIn this exercise we will look at the market trends for private residential property market for 2024 Q1 and see how the economic factors have affected it.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, we will use the residential real estate transaction data from REALIS. This provides comprehensive and up-to-date statistics on the private property market in Singapore.\nThe dataset has been provided via eLearn and added to the data/ folder of this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will refer to each data as the following:\n\n2023Q1: ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\n2023Q2: ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\n2023Q3: ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\n2023Q4: ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\n2024Q1: ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\n\n\n\n\nTo start the data analysis, we first need to prepare the R environment for analysis. This includes loading the R packages and loading the datasets.\nAfter the setup, we need to do data wrangling where we clean and transform the data into a form that is fitting for our analysis. This will possible entail removing irrelevant data, deriving additional variables, renaming columns, etc.\nAs part of wrangling, we need to decide on what data we would like to look at closely. For the purposes of this exercise, these are the data we can look at that can potentially give valuable insights:\n\nTotal units sold by quarter\nUnits sold by submarkets such as property type (e.g.Â condominium, terrace house, apartment, detached house), sale type (e.g.Â resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\nTransaction price by submarkets such property type (e.g.Â condominium, terrace house, apartment, detached house, etc), sale type (e.g.Â resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\n\nFinally, we will do data exploration and visualize the insights gained from the data. Some of the questions we would ask are:\n\nWhat is the general trend of private residential property sales prices?\nIs this trend consistent among all submarkets?\nHow affordable are private residential properties for Singaporean households?"

    "text": "4.1 Defining the audience and purpose of the visualizations\n\n4.1.1 Considerations\nIt is important to note that it is quite challenging to present all data available with just 3 visualizations. We cannot cover all ground and visualize the data from all perspectives, and some blind spots and biases are bound occur in the process.\nWith this in mind, it is important that we define the audience and purpose of the visualizations.\nThe audience is a prospective private property buyer that needs help answering these questions in making decisions on buying property:\n\nShould I buy a new property or a resale property?\nShould I buy a condo, apartment, or is it worth it to save more for a landed property?\nWhich districts should I consider when buying a property?\nDo I get a bargain compared to buying a property last year?\n\nTo answer the questions above, we will focus on exploring and visualizing the distribution among the different markets (New Sale, Resale, Sub Sale).\nThe points of interest are:\n\nPrices (unit and total)\nDistribution across different markets\nDistribution by property type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks when selecting data to present\n\n\n\nAs we have limited space to present data (within 2-3 visualizations), we cannot include all the data available to us.\nWith this, some perspectives may be missed and we will not be able to dive deep enough all aspects of the data.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Unit Price vs Transacted Price\nGiven AREA_SQFT and UNIT_PRICE_PSF, it is intuitive to expect that: \\[AREA\\_SQFT \\times UNIT\\_PRICE\\_PSF = TRANSACTED\\_PRICE\\]\nHowever, there are only 7 out of 26,936 transactions for which this is true.\n\nsales_txns %&gt;% filter(TRANSACTED_PRICE == AREA_SQFT * UNIT_PRICE_PSF) %&gt;% nrow()\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThis is because the final transacted price depends on other factors like size of property, floor height, where the property is facing, etc. Most of these factors are not reflected in the dataset we have.\nHence, to have a fairer comparison with what we have, we will use UNIT_PRICE_PSF for price comparisons.\n\n\n4.1.3 Compare all quarters or two quarters\nIn answering the questions we define (and based on the specifications of the exercise), the data partition for the visualization is by TYPE_OF_SALE as we want to look for trends from the different submarkets.\nWe current have 5 quarters in our dataset, 3 submarkets. This means 15 facets, which may be too much for division for visualization. It is also difficult to see at a glance when information we are trying to communicate if there are many very small graphs.\nIn addition, if we want to dive even deeper by PROPERTY_TYPE, which has 6 possible values, that is 90 data subsets we need to present.\nHence to simplify the visualization, we will choose only the 2023Q1 and 2024Q1, which should suffice for our purpose of comparing the state of the market to last yearâs as we are comparing the same time of the year.\nHence, we will produce the data frames to contain these data.\n\nsales_txns_q1_2324 &lt;- sales_txns %&gt;% filter(QUARTER %in% c(\"2023Q1\", \"2024Q1\"))\nsales_txns_q1_23 &lt;- sales_txns_q1_2324 %&gt;% filter(QUARTER == \"2023Q1\")\nsales_txns_q1_24 &lt;- sales_txns_q1_2324 %&gt;% filter(QUARTER == \"2024Q1\")"

This is to compare the prices at the same time of the year.\nFor this visualization, we will use the Unit Price per Sqft (UNIT_PRICE_PSF) instead of the Transaction Price (TRANSACTED_PRICE). This is so we can more fairly compare prices with less variables involved. With Transaction Price, the size of the property needs to be considered.\nWe will use the TYPE_OF_SALE column to partition the data so we can compare the trends across the Resale, New Sale and Sub Sale markets.\n\n4.2.1 Creating the base Visualization\nFor the visualization, we will use a Raincloud Plot so that we can see the patterns in the price trends, and whether there are clusters of interest within the data set.\nWe will also add a boxplot to accompany the half-density plot so that we can see the quantiles more clearly.\nTo compare the different quarters, we will use both left side and right side visualization to compare the quarters side by side.

Notable clusters in the graph suggest concentrated sales around specific price points, likely influenced by factors such as developer pricing and the location of New Launches. According to data from 99.co, there are fewer than 10 New Launches in 2024.\nNew Launched projects, particularly big ones, resulted in clusters on certain price points as they introduce fresh supply in the districts they are located in. The demand for these properties also contributed to the trend as transactions are completed by buyers.\n\nIn contrast, the Resale Market, which is comprised of properties already turned over by developers, shows a smoother distribution of prices. This is attributed to the wider variation in prices negotiated between buyers and sellers on available properties all over Singapore, which is not constrained by the parameters of specific projects.\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that visualization can be very misleading especially on the New Sale Market. Generalizing that the trends when there are notable cluster may not be representative of the real state of the market.\nHence, we need to look more deeply into these groups and present it as a visualizations so it can be better understood why there are groups that formed."

This is because we would like the user to recognize which districts are driving the price trends.\nWhen we plot all the districts, it is more difficult to identify by sight which districts are popular in a quarter and the other. This is because this plot has a lot of noise, which may not be that relevant to connect to the previous visualization.\n\n\n4.3.3 Generating the visualization\nWe will generate the visualization such that QUARTER is in column and TYPE_OF_SALE is in rows.\nWe will using facet_grid() to generate the visualization and adjust the theme elements as needed to make the plot more presentable.\n\n\nShow ggplot2 code\nviz2 &lt;- ggplot(popular_districts,\n       aes(\n         # Order the axis elements by rank\n         x = reorder(RANK,-RANK),\n         y = NUMBER_OF_SALES,\n         fill = QUARTER\n       )) +\n  \n  # Generate bar graph based on number of sales\n  geom_bar(\n    stat = \"identity\",\n    position = \"dodge\",\n    show.legend = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  \n  # Add descriptive label\n  geom_text(aes(\n    y = 10,\n    hjust = 0,\n    label = sprintf(\n      \"D%s: %d units sold at S$%0.2f psf\",\n      POSTAL_DISTRICT,\n      NUMBER_OF_SALES,\n      MEDIAN_PRICE_PSF\n    )\n  ), family = \"Roboto Condensed\") +\n  \n  # Generate horizontal bar\n  coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 600)) +\n  \n  # Set colors consistent with previous visualization\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"grey45\", \"blue\")) +\n  \n  # Generate facets, with labels to the left and at the bottom\n  facet_grid(TYPE_OF_SALE ~ QUARTER, switch = \"both\") +\n  \n  # Set plot texts\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Districts With Highest Units Sold for Each Submarket\",\n                  subtitle = \"New Sale Market is heavily influenced by the newly-launched projects in **D23** (Lumina Grand) and **D26** (Lentor Mansion).\",\n                  caption = \"Prices shown are **median unit price** per sqft\") &\n  # Set theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.line.x = element_line(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    # Use element_markdown so we can style the text\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(color = \"grey50\", size = rel(0.9)),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(color = \"grey50\"),\n    strip.placement = \"outside\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1))\n  )\nviz2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the texts in the visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nTexts such as xx units sold at $xxxx.xx were added in the plot so the information is easily digestible.\nHowever, it made the plot messy, and not aesthetically pleasing. Ideally, the full text should be rendered when interacting with the graph. I do not know how to do that right now, but it will be how I will present this visualization in the future.\nGiven this limit in my present abilities, I prioritized clarity of information over aesthetic considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\nPlotting the most popular districts for each submarket reveals that the Top 5 districts in the New Sale market, differs for the 2 quarters.\nIn 2023Q1, the distribution is more balanced and there were a lot of units sold in expensive districts like Districts 9 and 10. However, In 2024Q1, the number of units sold were skewed towards cheaper districts like Districts 23 and 26 where big projects like Lumina Grand and Lentor Mansion, respectively, were launched.\nThis is why the overall prices in the New Sale market appear to be much cheaper than the previous year, when in fact the new projects that launched are in cheaper districts.\nOn the contrary, the top districts in the Resale and Sub Sale markets have much less difference. This smaller change also resulted in a smaller impact on the overall median price in these markets."

This is why it is much cheaper.\nWe can also notice that there are much lower sales for some property types, like Terrace House, Semi-Detached House, and Detached House. These are landed properties, which are quite rare in Singapore so it is logical to see much fewer sales of these properties.\n\n\n4.4.2 Creating base visualizations\nFrom the insights gained from our initial exploration, we observed that prices differ by property types and that there are less sales on some property prices.\n\nUnit PriceVolume\n\n\nFor the unit price, we will use boxplot instead of density plots as we can see the distribution for different markets. If we use density plots, it is harder to present partitioned data in an easy to understand way.\nLastly, we will generate some reference lines for statistics (mean and median).\n\n\nShow ggplot2 code\n# Calculate stats for reference lines\nmedian_q1 &lt;- median(sales_txns_q1_24$UNIT_PRICE_PSF)\nmean_q1 &lt;- mean(sales_txns_q1_24$UNIT_PRICE_PSF)\n\nunit_price_by_prop_type &lt;- ggplot(sales_txns_q1_24,\n                                  aes(x = PROPERTY_TYPE, y = UNIT_PRICE_PSF, fill = TYPE_OF_SALE)) +\n  \n  # Generate different boxplots for each market and property type\n  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE,\n               width = 0.4,\n               alpha = 0.8) +\n  \n  # Render median reference line\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = median_q1, color = \"Median\"),\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             alpha = 0.8) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 6.6,\n    y = ifelse(median_q1 &lt; mean_q1, median_q1 - 200, median_q1 + 250),\n    label = paste0(\"Median =\\n$\", median_q1),\n    family = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n    color = \"brown\",\n    size = 3,\n    alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  \n  # Render mean reference line\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_q1, color = \"Mean\"),\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             alpha = 0.8) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 6.6,\n    y = ifelse(mean_q1 &lt; median_q1, mean_q1 - 200, mean_q1 + 250),\n    label = paste0(\"Mean =\\n$\", round(mean_q1, 0)),\n    family = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n    color = \"darkgreen\",\n    size = 3,\n    alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  \n  # Set labels\n  labs(x = \"Property Type\",\n       y = \"Unit Price Per Sqft ($)\",\n       fill = \"Market\",\n       color = \"Statistics\") +\n  \n  # Wrap long labels using `wrap_format()` from `scale` package\n  # Add some space to the right for Statistics annotations\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = wrap_format(10), expand = expansion(add = c(0.6, 1))) +\n  \n  # Set colors\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"blue\", \"gold3\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkgreen\", \"brown\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    # Remove axis text. Combining this with the price visualization will stack the 2 graphs\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\nunit_price_by_prop_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the graph that some box plots are very short, which is especially true for Landed properties as there are few units sold for these property types.\n\n\nAs companion to the unit price graph, we will also generate a simple bar graph for the volume.\n\n\nShow ggplot2 code\nsales_volume_by_prop_type &lt;-\n  ggplot(\n    sales_txns_q1_24,\n    aes(x = PROPERTY_TYPE, fill = TYPE_OF_SALE)\n  ) +\n  \n  # Generate stacked bar graph by TYPE_OF_SALE\n  # Do not show label as the price graph will show it\n  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, width = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  \n  # Generate labels for stacked bar areas\n  # Do not show label as the price graph will show it\n  # Use ggrepel as some areas in the bar graph are too small to render th text inside\n  geom_label_repel(\n    aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n    stat = \"count\",\n    position = \"stack\",\n    family = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n    size = 2.5,\n    alpha = 0.8,\n    color = \"white\",\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  \n  # Apply colors\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"blue\", \"gold3\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Units Sold\") +\n  \n  # Wrap long titles\n  # Apply same \"expand\" so axes align\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = wrap_format(10), expand = expansion(add = c(0.6, 1))) +\n  \n  # Appply theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme()\n\nsales_volume_by_prop_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume graph provides additional information about sales by property type. Some property types with lower sales volume may show a longer boxplot, which may be interpreted as more units sold.\nWith this companion graph, it is easier to cross-reference the price with the volume to better judge how representative of the market the unit prices are.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Generating the visualization\nFinally, we will generate the visualization by stacking the 2 graphs and doing final touches on the styling and texts.\n\n\nShow ggplot2 code\nviz3 &lt;- (unit_price_by_prop_type / sales_volume_by_prop_type ) +\n  plot_layout(heights = c(5,1)) +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Singapore Private Property Sales by Property Type for 2024 Q1\",\n                  subtitle = \"**Executive Condiminiums** sold at the lowest unit prices, while **Apartments** and **Condominiums** sold at the highest unit prices.\") &\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    legend.location = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(color = \"grey50\", size = rel(0.9)),\n  )\nviz3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\nFrom our initial exploration, we have already established that Executive Condominiums are cheapest in terms of unit price.\nAnother surprising observation is that despite having more Executive Condominiums sold, its boxplot is notably shorter compared to Detached and Semi-Detached Houses, in both the New Sale and Resale Markets. This disparity may be attributed to HDBâs price regulation on Executive Condominiums, resulting in reduced price variability compared to other property types.\nIt can also be observed that there are much fewer sales in the New Sales market of landed properties. It could be due to the fact that compared to Strata developments, Landed properties are usually bespoke to their ownerâs use. In addition to the fact that landed properties are rare in Singapore, is it expected to see less New Sales in this category.\nLastly, the mean is higher than the median price which means that the unit prices are skewed towards the higher end of the scale. What this means it that prices tend to be more expensive than cheaper."

    "text": "5.2 Overall Insights\nWe found that the 2024 New Sales market experienced an sizable decrease is overall prices (7.6%) compared to the same period last year. However, it should be noted that this is due to New Launches located in cheaper districts, compared to the same period last year where that launches where in central districts like 9 and 10.\nAnother very interesting insight is that different property prices experience big variations in prices, while Executive Condominiums have smaller variations. This is because of the more controlled and regulated environment as these properties are under the jurisdiction of HDB. This is why although median prices are at S$1736 in 2024Q1, it is possible to find a more affordable property when looking at Executive Condominiums.\nHence, a prospective buyer must take generalizations in the housing market with the grain of salt as overall market trends may not reflect the situation in the market they are interested in. This is why when thinking of buying a property, it is important to be more specific on the kind of property you are looking for (e.g.Â which district, property type, new or resale, etc) and narrow down on the trends for each of those. They must do their own due diligence in researching the market they are interested in to make a sound decision on their purchase."

My own bias and limitations also reflect the output as I had to limit myself to looking at 2 quarters as I cannot imagine how to present data from all 5 quarters effectively with the level of detail in the different submarkets and property type.\nHowever, I realized that with the details available to us, it is impossible to cover everything. It is more important to tailor the visualization to our target audience, and even then we may not be able to provide everything they need.\nI am now more aware that as a data visualization consumer, I must do my on due diligence to dive deep into the details as the visualizations may be too general or too detailed for our own needs. Some data may be omitted or data due to various limitations.\nAs a student, there were also some frustrating moments as I wanted to present data in a certain way but my current abilities limit me from presenting data in such a way (especially on Visualization 2). As I progress in this course, I will challenge myself to implement those ideas as I expand my own learning."

Even if there is no malicious intent, if some values have text that can affect Javascript parsing, the interactive plot may not work as expected.\nThis particular dataset and Singapore Open Data datasets are trusted so there is less concern for this happening. However, some caution is needed when using untrusted sources.\nI will do some tests at a later time to check if ggiraph is vulnerable to such attacks so that I can apply measures to prevent XSS."

    "text": "3.2 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\nA Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThatâs because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{likelihood\\ of\\ data\\ given H_1}{likelihood\\ of\\ data\\ given H_0} = \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D|H_0)}\n\\]\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor."

This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\nIf we need emphasize the actual values with color gradient, using colors is appropriate. However, It may not be necessary when there are fewer ridge graphs, since the farthest graph is still relatively close to the axis.\nHowever, in the plot below, it can be more easily seen that 3I scored lowest, while 3A scored the highest among the different classes.

It reduces misinterpretation of the data."

    "text": "In this exercise, we will be tacking Mini-case 3 of VAST Challenge 2024.\nWe will answer Questions 3 and 4 from the mini-challenge:\n\n\nDevelop a visual approach to examine inferences. Infer how the influence of a company changes through time. Can you infer ownership or influence that a network may have?\nIdentify the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and visualize how this network and competing businesses change as a result of their illegal fishing behavior. Which companies benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp legal troubles? Are there other suspicious transactions that may be related to illegal fishing? Provide visual evidence for your conclusions.\n\n\nIf you want to skip through all the exploration and go straight to the answer, go to 9 Mini-Challenge 3.\n\n\nWe will use the dataset provided by VAST Challenge. It is a network data that contains nodes that represent the different entities in the fishing business industry, and edges which represent the relationships between different entities.\n\n\n\nTo answer this questions, we will investigate the changes in the fishing business community through time. We will do this by creating animations of the network through time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, animations cannot be generated due to the limitations of compatibility of plotly and gganimate with ggraph.\nSee 5.3 Animations for details.\n\n\n\nSecondly, we will identify the influential entities in the network. We will do this by first visually inspecting the network and making inferences.\nLastly, we will use measures of centrality to verify our inferences.\nFor the purposes of this exercise we will define 2 types of influential entity:\n\nPower holders - Those who hold the most power and beneficiary of resources in the network. We will use pagerank centrality to identify power holders.\nPower brokers - Those who facilitate the transfer of power/resources from a less powerful entity to another. We will use betweenness centrality to identify power brokers."

This puts StichtingMarine Shipping Company outside of SouthSeafood Express Corpâs sphere of influence.\nThis can be an effort to distance the owners from SouthSeafood Express Corpâs illegal activity, especially as it is put under the non-fishing company branch of StichtingMarine Shipping Company (under Namorna Transit Ltd and V. Miesel Shipping).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision\n\n\n\nWe will hide inactive edges so that the nodes donât move upon re-rendering, and makes it easy to compare."

In addition, gganimate does not accept ggraph plots as frames.\nAs a workaround, we will just use Quatroâs tabset to visualize the changes via tab switches."

    "text": "7.1 Appropriate measures of centrality\n\nPower HoldersPower Brokers\n\n\nTo identify the most powerful nodes/entities in the network, we will use page rank centrality. Originally developed by Google, this is used in ranking web pages. The principle is that the more incoming edges a node has, the more influential it is and nodes to which they are connected share of that influence. (Disney, 2020)\nThis measure for centrality is useful in this context as in our power graph, the node where the power flow stops is the most powerful node as they have the ultimate control over all the nodes inwardly connected to them.\nThe main candidates for these are the BeneficialOwners and Shareholders.\n\n\nTo identify the power brokers, we will use betweenness centrality.\nPower Brokers must be nodes with both incoming and outgoing edges, so that they can connect a more powerful node to a less powerful node. Hence, having a large number of edges connected to a node is not enough (which the degree centrality offers).\nThis is because if a node only has incoming or outgoing edges, it wonât be able to connect to other nodes to keep the flow going."

This can be because of her association as family member of Fintan Park and Nathan Conti.\nIn hindsight, we could have put more weight to business connections to our model in 6.3 Score tables as it could be the case that family members are not really involved in the business (will apply this in the project).\nAnother observation is that the plot in 8.1 Power Holders - Sphere of influence shows Liam and Nadia Conti as more powerful than Fintan Park. However, in the wider network, Fintan Park is more powerful.\nLastly, similar to the previous observation, the impact of SouthSeafood Express Corpâs change in shareholders have little impact on the power holders in this network - the Conti Clan members"

Hover on the nodes to see more details.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanaa El-Amin is not influential, according to the metrics that we set but she works with a lot of companies in the network. This includes GvardeyskAmerica Shipping Plc , NamRiver Transit A/S, and StichtingMarine Shipping Company, which are the strongest power brokers in the network.\nIt can imply that she is an expert in the industry so various companies hire her (perhaps as a consultant). Although she does not own any companies, nor hold shares in any, she may hold some influence in the network as influential companies depend on her services.\n\n8.5.1 Measures of centrality to identify this influence\nPossible measures of centrality that can identify her influence could be eigenvector centrality. In eigenvector centrality, the principle the more influential your neighbors are, the more influential you are. This can be interpreted such that her association with influential companies also gives her influence.\nOther measures of centrality that can identify this particular are hub centrality (due to her direct connection with influential nodes) and degree centrality (due to the number of outgoing edges).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we update the power model?\n\n\n\nDespite this observation, we will not update the power model, nor add another measure of centrality to our visualizations.\nThis is because we acknowledged that the model we created in 6.3 Score tables is imperfect and we lack information to model the power dynamics in the network accurately.\nHowever, it is enough that we learn that our model will not identify all influential people in the network, and can even misidentify some entities as influential."

Which companies benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp legal troubles? Are there other suspicious transactions that may be related to illegal fishing? Provide visual evidence for your conclusions.\n\n\nThe previous question already covers the change in influence of entities.
