Due to Singapore’s successful public housing program, 77.8% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats, while 22% live in private properties like condos or landed properties.\nWhile the HDB market targets Singaporeans with household income of up to 14,000 SGD, the private housing market is Singapore is still in demand for households looking to upgrade, invest their property, and for residents not eligible for public housing (e.g. high income household, foreigners, etc.)\nIn this exercise we will look at the market trends for private residential property market for 2024 Q1 and see how the economic factors have affected it.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, we will use the residential real estate transaction data from REALIS. This provides comprehensive and up-to-date statistics on the private property market in Singapore.\nThe dataset has been provided via eLearn and added to the data/ folder of this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will refer to each data as the following:\n\n2023Q1: ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\n2023Q2: ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\n2023Q3: ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\n2023Q4: ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\n2024Q1: ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\n\n\n\n\nTo start the data analysis, we first need to prepare the R environment for analysis. This includes loading the R packages and loading the datasets.\nAfter the setup, we need to do data wrangling where we clean and transform the data into a form that is fitting for our analysis. This will possible entail removing irrelevant data, deriving additional variables, renaming columns, etc.\nNext, we need to decide on what data we would like to look at closely. For the purposes of this exercise, these are the data we can look at that can potentially give valuable insights:\n\nTotal units sold by quarter\nUnits sold by submarkets such as property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\nTransaction price by submarkets such property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\n\nFinally, we will do data exploration and visualize the insights gained from the data. Some of the questions we would ask are:\n\nWhat is the general quarterly trend of private residential property sales prices?\nIs this trend consistent among all submarkets?\nHow affordable are private residential properties for Singaporean households?"

    "text": "To start the data analysis, we first need to prepare the R environment for analysis. This includes loading the R packages and loading the datasets.\nAfter the setup, we need to do data wrangling where we clean and transform the data into a form that is fitting for our analysis. This will possible entail removing irrelevant data, deriving additional variables, renaming columns, etc.\nNext, we need to decide on what data we would like to look at closely. For the purposes of this exercise, these are the data we can look at that can potentially give valuable insights:\n\nTotal units sold by quarter\nUnits sold by submarkets such as property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\nTransaction price by submarkets such property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.\n\nFinally, we will do data exploration and visualize the insights gained from the data. Some of the questions we would ask are:\n\nWhat is the general quarterly trend of private residential property sales prices?\nIs this trend consistent among all submarkets?\nHow affordable are private residential properties for Singaporean households?"

We will create a helper function that will help us accomplish this:\n\nrename_realis_column &lt;- function(orig_name) {\n  # Add underscores to spaces\n  gsub(\" +\", \"_\",\n       # Remove special

    "text": "3.5 Handling the bulk transactions\nTo address the 12 bulk transactions in our dataframe, we have 2 possible options:\n\nOption 1: Remove these transactions as these correspond to 0.045% of transactions (EASY)\nOption 2: Create rows for each unit in the transaction (HARD)\n\nAlthough Option 2 is more difficult, it is the better approach as all the transactions are Resale transactions. Simply removing them may remove very important data for the resale submarket.\nFor this solution, we need to do the following:\n\nRepeat all rows by NUMBER_OF_UNITS times.\nSet transacted price to the average price: \\(\\frac{TRANSACTED\\_PRICE}{NUMBER\\_OF\\_UNITS}\\).\nSet the area (sqft) to the average area: \\(\\frac{AREA\\_SQFT}{NUMBER\\_OF\\_UNITS}\\).\nSet NUMBER_OF_UNITS to 1.\n\n\nRepeating rowsSetting column values\n\n\nReference: Stackoverflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions used\n\n\n\nrep() - to repeat a dataframe\nseq_len(nrow()) - to iterate to each row of the dataframe\n\n\n\nrealis_per_unit &lt;- realis[rep(seq_len(nrow(realis)), realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS),]\n\nLets’ check if the number of rows correspond to the total number of units sold.\n\nnrow(realis_per_unit) == sum(realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nWe will perform the changes to NUMBER_OF_UNITS, TRANSACTED_PRICE, AREA_SQFT in 1 code chunk so that rerunning the code chunk is idempotent and won’t mutate the variable further\n\nrealis_per_unit &lt;- realis_per_unit %&gt;%\n  filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TRANSACTED_PRICE = round(TRANSACTED_PRICE / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(AREA_SQFT = round(AREA_SQFT / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(NUMBER_OF_UNITS = 1) %&gt;%\n  rbind(realis_per_unit %&gt;% # Reconnect to the rest of the dataframe\n              filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS == 1))\n\n\n\n\nLet us verify the result of the transformation.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\nrealis %&gt;%\n  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(\n    \"TXN00001\", \"TXN00002\", # Single-unit transactions\n    \"TXN10593\", \"TXN13376\" # Bulk transactions\n    )) %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTXN_ID\nQUARTER\nNUMBER_OF_UNITS\nTRANSACTED_PRICE\nAREA_SQFT\nTYPE_OF_SALE\nPROPERTY_TYPE\nTYPE_OF_AREA\nPOSTAL_DISTRICT\nPLANNING_REGION\nPLANNING_AREA\nTENURE\nUNIT_PRICE_PSF\nCOMPLETION_DATE\nPURCHASER_ADDRESS_INDICATOR\n\n\n\n\nTXN00001\n2023-1\n1\n2317000\n882.65\nNew Sale\nCondominium\nStrata\n04\nCentral Region\nBukit Merah\n99 yrs from 12/01/2021\n2625\nUncompleted\nHDB\n\n\nTXN00002\n2023-1\n1\n1823500\n882.65\nNew Sale\nCondominium\nStrata\n14\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n2066\nUncompleted\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN10593\n2023-2\n4\n10600000\n6746.88\nResale\nApartment\nStrata\n15\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n1571\n1985\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN13376\n2023-3\n2\n8000000\n3658.68\nResale\nSemi-Detached House\nLand\n14\nCentral Region\nGeylang\nFreehold\n2187\n-\nPrivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrealis_per_unit %&gt;%\n  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(\n    \"TXN00001\", \"TXN00002\", # Single-unit transactions\n    \"TXN10593\", \"TXN13376\" # Bulk transactions\n    )) %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTXN_ID\nQUARTER\nNUMBER_OF_UNITS\nTRANSACTED_PRICE\nAREA_SQFT\nTYPE_OF_SALE\nPROPERTY_TYPE\nTYPE_OF_AREA\nPOSTAL_DISTRICT\nPLANNING_REGION\nPLANNING_AREA\nTENURE\nUNIT_PRICE_PSF\nCOMPLETION_DATE\nPURCHASER_ADDRESS_INDICATOR\n\n\n\n\nTXN10593\n2023-2\n1\n2650000\n1687.00\nResale\nApartment\nStrata\n15\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n1571\n1985\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN10593\n2023-2\n1\n2650000\n1687.00\nResale\nApartment\nStrata\n15\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n1571\n1985\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN10593\n2023-2\n1\n2650000\n1687.00\nResale\nApartment\nStrata\n15\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n1571\n1985\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN10593\n2023-2\n1\n2650000\n1687.00\nResale\nApartment\nStrata\n15\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n1571\n1985\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN13376\n2023-3\n1\n4000000\n1829.00\nResale\nSemi-Detached House\nLand\n14\nCentral Region\nGeylang\nFreehold\n2187\n-\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN13376\n2023-3\n1\n4000000\n1829.00\nResale\nSemi-Detached House\nLand\n14\nCentral Region\nGeylang\nFreehold\n2187\n-\nPrivate\n\n\nTXN00001\n2023-1\n1\n2317000\n882.65\nNew Sale\nCondominium\nStrata\n04\nCentral Region\nBukit Merah\n99 yrs from 12/01/2021\n2625\nUncompleted\nHDB\n\n\nTXN00002\n2023-1\n1\n1823500\n882.65\nNew Sale\nCondominium\nStrata\n14\nEast Region\nBedok\nFreehold\n2066\nUncompleted\nPrivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave point\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us save realis_per_unit so we do not need to rerun the steps above.\n\nwrite_rds(realis_per_unit, \"data/rds/realis_per_unit.rds\")"
