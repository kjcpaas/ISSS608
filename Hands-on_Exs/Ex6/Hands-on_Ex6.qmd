# 1 Overview

This hands-on exercise covers [Chapter 27: Modelling, Visualising and Analysing Network Data with R](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27).

I learned about the following:

-   create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of *dplyr*, *lubridate*, and *tidygraph*,

-   build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of *ggraph*,

-   compute network geometrics using *tidygraph*,

-   build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and

-   build interactive network visualisation using *visNetwork* package.

# 2 Getting Started

## 2.1 Loading the required packages

For this exercise we will use the following R packages:

-   igraph

-   tidygraph

-   ggraph

-   visNetwork

-   tidyverse

-   graphlayouts

-   clock

-   [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

```{r}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts)
```

## 2.2 Importing Data

### 2.2.1 About the data set

*GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.

This becomes the **edges** or lines in our network.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image2.jpg)

*GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.

This becomes the **nodes** or points in our network.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image1.jpg)

### 2.2.2 Importing the data

We will import the data using `read_csv`.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_node.csv")
GAStech_edges <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")
```

### 2.2.3 Initial look at the data

::: panel-tabset
#### GAStech_nodes

```{r}
head(GAStech_nodes)
```

Contains the list of employees and their role information

#### GAStech_edges

```{r}
head(GAStech_edges)
```

Contains messages from one person to another.
:::

# 3 Data Wrangling

## 3.1 Reviewing the edges data

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The *SentDate* is treated as “Character” data type instead of *date* data type. This is an error! Before we continue, it is important for us to change the data type of *SentDate* field back to “Date”” data type.
:::

## 3.2 Converting dates to Date datatype

We will add 2 columns to `GAStech_edges`, `SendDate` (date parse in DMY format), `Weekday` (what day of the week). These are generated from `SentDate` using `lubridate` functions.

```{r}
GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%
  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,
                        label = TRUE,
                        abbr = FALSE))
```

Checking `GAStech_edges` now have these new columns.

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

## 3.3 Aggregating data

The edges data is not useful for network analysis as the contain **individual** correspondence. We instead want how many messages are sent between 2 people.

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%
    summarise(Weight = n()) %>%
  filter(source!=target) %>%
  filter(Weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

With this change we now how many messages are sent between 2 people in each day of the week. We will use this dataframe for analyzing and visualizing network data.

# 4 Creating network objects using tidygraph

**tidygraph** provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.

References:

-   [Introducing tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)

-   [tidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2018/tidygraph-1-1-a-tidy-hope/)

## 4.1 tbl_graph object

Two functions of **tidygraph** package can be used to create network objects, they are:

-   [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) creates a **tbl_graph** network object from nodes and edges data.

-   [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) converts network data and objects to a **tbl_graph** network. Below are network data and objects supported by `as_tbl_graph()`

    -   a node data.frame and an edge data.frame,

    -   data.frame, list, matrix from base,

    -   igraph from igraph,

    -   network from network,

    -   dendrogram and hclust from stats,

    -   Node from data.tree,

    -   phylo and evonet from ape, and

    -   graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).

## 4.2 The dplyr verbs in tidygraph

-   *activate()* verb from **tidygraph** serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to **tbl_graph** object are applied to the active tibble.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image3.jpg)

-   In the above the *.N()* function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly *.E()* will give you the edge data and *.G()* will give you the **tbl_graph** object itself.

## 4.3 Using `tbl_graph()` to build tidygraph data model

We will use `tbl_graph` to build the network model:

```{r}
GAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,
                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, 
                           directed = TRUE)
```

This is a directed graph, so the direction of the messages is relevant.

## 4.4 Getting to know about the output

```{r}
GAStech_graph
```

-   The output above reveals that *GAStech_graph* is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.

-   The command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.

-   It states that the Node Data is **active**. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.

## 4.5 Changing the active object

The nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the *activate()* function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use *activate()* and then *arrange()*.

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  arrange(desc(Weight))
```

# 5 Plotting Static Network Graphs with ggraph package

[**ggraph**](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/) is an extension of **ggplot2**, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.

As in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a **ggraph**’s network graph, they are:

-   [nodes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Nodes.html),

-   [edges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Edges.html) and

-   [layouts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Layouts.html).

For a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.

## 5.1 Plotting a basic network graph

The code chunk below uses [*ggraph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/ggraph.html), [*geom-edge_link()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_edge_link.html) and [*geom_node_point()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_node_point.html) to plot a network graph by using *GAStech_graph*. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

## 5.2 Changing the default network graph theme

n this section, you will use [*theme_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/theme_graph.html) to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

## 5.3 Changing the coloring of the plot

Furthermore, `theme_graph()` makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))

g + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',
                text_colour = 'white')
```

## 5.4 Working with ggraph’s layouts

**ggraph** support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by `ggraph()`.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image4.jpg) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image5.jpg)

## 5.5 Different graph layouts

The code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using different layouts

Other documentation:

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Layouts.html>

-   <https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/layout_tbl_graph_igraph.html>

::: panel-tabset
### Fruchterman and Reingold

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes()) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Nicely

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes()) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Grid

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "grid") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes()) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Spring-based algorithm

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes()) +
  theme_graph()
```
:::

## 5.6 Modifying network nodes

We will color the nodes depending on the department.

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = 3)) +
  theme_graph()
```

## 5.7 Modifiying edges

We will modify the thickness of the edges/lines based on `Width`.

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 3) +
  theme_graph()
```

# 6 Creating facet graphs

Another very useful feature of **ggraph** is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.

There are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:

-   [*facet_nodes()*](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27) whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,

-   [*facet_edges()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_edges.html) whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and

-   [*facet_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_graph.html) faceting on two variables simultaneously.

## 6.1 Working with *facet_edges()*

We can create facets for graph for each day of the week. We can do this as we have a `Weekday` column in our data.

```{r}
set_graph_style()

ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) +
  facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

## 6.2 Changing the legend position

We can change the position of the legend through the `theme()` function.

```{r}
set_graph_style()

ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

## 6.3 Adding frame to each facet

We can also add frames to each facet.

```{r}
set_graph_style() 

ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) + facet_edges(~Weekday) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## 6.4 Working with *facet_nodes()*

We can also facet by nodes. In our case, let's try to facet by **Department**.

```{r}
set_graph_style()

ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) +
  facet_nodes(~Department)+
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

# 7 Network Metrics Analysis

## 7.1 Computing centrality indices

Centrality measures are a collection of statistical indices use to describe the relative important of the actors are to a network. There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here.

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,
            size=betweenness_centrality), alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_graph()
```

## 7.2 Visualising network metrics

We can also compute the central tendency from ggraph itself, without pre-computing like when we added `betweenness_centrality` column above.

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = centrality_betweenness())) +
  theme_graph()
```

## 7.3 Visualising Community

Communities are a group of nodes that are closely-knit. The measure of being closely-knit is the `Weight` column in our graph.

Other references: <https://towardsdatascience.com/community-detection-algorithms-9bd8951e7dae>

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness(weights = Weight, directed = TRUE))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community)) +
  theme_graph()
```

# 8 Building interactive network graph with visNetwork 

## 8.1 Data preparation

Before we can plot the interactive network graph, we need to prepare the data model. We will add the labels to the nodes in the edge graph. This is why we will join the edge and node dataframes.

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(from = id) %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("targetLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(to = id) %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
    summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  filter(from!=to) %>%
  filter(weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## 8.2 Plotting the first interactive network graph

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, 
           GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

## 8.3 Working with layout

We can also change the layout of the interactive graph. In this example, Fruchterman and Reingold layout is used.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") 
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
We can zoom in and out to see the details and the overall structure, respectively.
:::

## 8.4 Working with visual attributes - Nodes

visNetwork() looks for a field called “group” in the nodes object and colour the nodes according to the values of the group field.

We will create a `group` column from `Department`.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- GAStech_nodes %>%
  mutate(group = Department)
```

After adding the `group` column, we can replot.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

## 8.5 **Working with visual attributes - Edges**

In the code run below *visEdges()* is used to symbolise the edges.\
- The argument *arrows* is used to define where to place the arrow.\
- The *smooth* argument is used to plot the edges using a smooth curve.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visEdges(arrows = "to", 
           smooth = list(enabled = TRUE, 
                         type = "curvedCW")) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

## 8.6 Adding Interactivity

In the code chunk below, *visOptions()* is used to incorporate interactivity features in the data visualisation.

-   The argument *highlightNearest* highlights nearest when clicking a node.

-   The argument *nodesIdSelection* adds an id node selection creating an HTML select element.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,
             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

# 9 Reflections

This exercise is one of the most interesting for me as I have been plotting network graphs for my personal project before (using Javascript).

It was eye-opening to know that there are different layouts that can be used. I always thought they are randomly-generated.
