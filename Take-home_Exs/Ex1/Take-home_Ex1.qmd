# 1 Overview

## 1.1 Background

Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world at 89.7%, [2nd only to Russia among the G20](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/home-ownership-rate?continent=g20) countries. Due to Singapore's successful public housing program, [77.8% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats](13+%20Housing%20&%20Household%20Statistics%20in%20Singapore%20(2024)), while 22% live in private properties like condos or landed properties.

While the HDB market targets Singaporeans with household income of up to 14,000 SGD, the private housing market is Singapore is still in demand for households looking to upgrade, invest their property, and for residents not eligible for public housing (e.g. high income household, foreigners, etc.)

In this exercise we will look at the market trends for private residential property market for 2024 Q1 and see how the economic factors have affected it.

## 1.2 Loading the data sources

For this exercise, we will use the residential real estate transaction data from [REALIS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/index). This provides comprehensive and up-to-date statistics on the private property market in Singapore.

The dataset has been provided via eLearn and added to the `data/` folder of this exercise.

### File Structure

![](images/file_structure.png)
:::

For the purposes of this exercise, we will refer to each data as the following:

-   **2023Q1**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv`

-   **2023Q2**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv`

-   **2023Q3**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv`

-   **2023Q4**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv`

-   **2024Q1**: `ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv`

## 1.3 Methodology

To start the data analysis, we first need to prepare the R environment for analysis. This includes loading the R packages and loading the datasets.

After the setup, we need to do data wrangling where we clean and transform the data into a form that is fitting for our analysis. This will possible entail removing irrelevant data, deriving additional variables, renaming columns, etc.

Next, we need to decide on what data we would like to look at closely. For the purposes of this exercise, these are the data we can look at that can potentially give valuable insights:

-   Total units sold by quarter

-   Units sold by submarkets such as property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.

-   Transaction price by submarkets such property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.

Finally, we will do data exploration and visualize the insights gained from the data. Some of the questions we would ask are:

-   What is the general quarterly trend of private residential property sales prices?

-   Is this trend consistent among all submarkets?

-   How affordable are private residential properties for Singaporean households?

# 2 Setup

## 2.1 Loading the R packages

For this exercise, we will mainly use the following packages:

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): collection of R packages used in data science, which includes [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), among others
-   ggtext: Enhanced text formating
-   ggdist: half_eye plot

Aside from these, we will also include other packages that will help us present the data better.

-   [knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.45): used for dynamic report generation in R. For this exercise, we will use this package to render our tables better.

```{r}
#| label: setup
pacman::p_load(knitr, tidyverse, patchwork, ggdist, ggtext, ggpubr, treemapify)
```

## 2.2 Data Checkpoints

As the analysis is expected to have a lot of intermediate steps, **Save**, **Load**, and **Data clear** points are available to make our data wrangling more efficient.

::: callout-tip
### Save point

This is where data is written as `rds` files using `write_rds()` for important data sets that will be used in later analysis. Examples are:

-   Data we need to prepare for analysis
-   Critical outputs of expensive calculations
-   Cleaned up data for lightweight processing
:::

::: callout-note
### Load point

This is where data is loaded from `rds` files using `read_rds()`. They were previously generated by the save point.

**TIP**: Skip to the load points to progress without running the code above it
:::

::: callout-warning
### Data clear point

This is where data that will not be used anymore are cleared. The data in RStudio environment will pile up and will make it more difficult to check the relevant data in each part.

We can set `#| eval: false` in code chunks if we want skip the clearing. For example, the code below won't be run.

```{r}
#| eval: false
message <- "This code chunk executed"
```
:::

To use these checkpoints, we need to create `data/rds` folder.

# 3 Data Wrangling

## 3.1 Importing the datasets

Upon inspection of the csv files, column names have human-readable titles such as "Project Name", "Transacted Price (\$)", etc. While good for humans, these column names may cause parsing issues with R, especially as there are special characters.

Because of this, we will rename the columns in their UPPER_CASE format after removing the special characters. We will create a helper function that will help us accomplish this:

```{r}
rename_realis_column <- function(orig_name) {
  # Add underscores to spaces
  gsub(" +", "_",
       # Remove special characters
       gsub("[^A-Z ]", "",
            # Convert to upper case and remove trailing spaces
            toupper(orig_name)) %>% trimws())
}
```

We will use `read_csv()` to import each file and use `rename_realis_column()` in the `rename_with()` function.

::: panel-tabset
### 2023 Q1

```{r}
realis_2023q1 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q1, n=7))
```

There are **4,722** private residential propertysales for 2023 Q1.

### 2023 Q2

```{r}
realis_2023q2 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q2, n=7))
```

There are **6,125** private residential property sales for 2023 Q2.

### 2023 Q3

```{r}
realis_2023q3 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q3, n=7))
```

There are **6,206** private residential property sales for 2023 Q3.

### 2023 Q4

```{r}
realis_2023q4 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q4, n=7))
```

There are **4,851** private residential property sales for 2023 Q4.

### 2024 Q1

```{r}
realis_2024q1 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2024q1, n=7))
```

There are **4,902** private residential property sales for 2024 Q1.
:::

```{r}
glimpse(realis_2023q1)
```

The imported dataset has 21 variables.

## 3.2 Combining the dataframes

Next, we will combine all 5 `realis_202*q*` dataframes into a single one to simplify aggregation and partitioning of data for analysis.

This will also simplify cleanup and transformation as they will be done on a single dataframe instead of 5.

To do this, we need to add `QUARTER` values to each dataframe before merging them to a single one. We will use the format `<YEAR>Q<QUARTER>`, i.e `2024Q1` for 2024 Q1. This is so we can identify which quarter the sale was made, which we will use for aggregation.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
### Functions used

-   `mutate()` for adding new column

-   `rbind()` for combining all dataframes

-   `seq_len()` and `nrow()` for generating a sequence of IDs

-   `sprintf()` for formatting a string.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Adding QUARTER column

```{r}
realis_2023q1 <- mutate(realis_2023q1, QUARTER="2023Q1")
realis_2023q2 <- mutate(realis_2023q2, QUARTER="2023Q2")
realis_2023q3 <- mutate(realis_2023q3, QUARTER="2023Q3")
realis_2023q4 <- mutate(realis_2023q4, QUARTER="2023Q4")
realis_2024q1 <- mutate(realis_2024q1, QUARTER="2024Q1")
```

### Combining data frames

```{r}
realis <- realis_2023q1 %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q2) %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q3) %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q4) %>%
  rbind(realis_2024q1)
kable(head(realis, n=10))
```

### Adding transaction ID's (TXN_ID)

We will also add `TXN_ID` so we can more easily refer to the observations later on. The format is `TXN00000`.

```{r}
realis$TXN_ID <- sprintf("TXN%05d", seq_len(nrow(realis)))
```

### Verifying the result

Let us check if all rows are accounted for by checking if the number of rows in `realis` is the total number of rows from all dataframes.

```{r}
nrow(realis) == nrow(realis_2023q1) +
  nrow(realis_2023q2) +
  nrow(realis_2023q3) +
  nrow(realis_2023q4) +
  nrow(realis_2024q1)
```

## 3.3 Filtering relevant columns

After adding the `QUARTER` and `TXN_ID` columns, there are now 23 variables in the dataframe. However, not all of them are relevant to answer the questions we are asking. The table below summarizes the columns and whether we will keep them or not.

### Filter code

We will now use `select()` to keep only the relevant columns. We will define the function below for filtering the relevant columns. This will also rearrange the columns based on the order in the function call.

```{r}
realis <-
  realis %>% select(
    c(
      TXN_ID,
      PROJECT_NAME,
      QUARTER,
      NUMBER_OF_UNITS,
      TRANSACTED_PRICE,
      AREA_SQFT,
      TYPE_OF_SALE,
      PROPERTY_TYPE,
      TYPE_OF_AREA,
      POSTAL_DISTRICT,
      PLANNING_REGION,
      PLANNING_AREA,
      TENURE,
      UNIT_PRICE_PSF,
      COMPLETION_DATE,
      PURCHASER_ADDRESS_INDICATOR
    )
  )
```
:::

After this initial cleanup, we are left with 15 variables relevant to our exploration.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Save point

Let us save `realis` so we do not need to rerun the steps above.

```{r}
write_rds(realis, "data/rds/realis_after_clean.rds")
```
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
### Data clear point

We do not need the `realis_202*q*` dataframes anymore so we can remove them from the RStudio environment.

```{r}
#| eval: true
rm(realis_2023q1)
rm(realis_2023q2)
rm(realis_2023q3)
rm(realis_2023q4)
rm(realis_2024q1)
```
:::

## 3.4 Closer look at NUMBER_OF_UNITS

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Load point

We can continue running the document from this point by loading the following prepared data.

```{r}
realis <- read_rds("data/rds/realis_after_clean.rds")
```
:::

Taking a closer look at `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` columns reveals that **12 out of 26,806 transactions** involve multiple units.

```{r}
realis[order(-realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS),] %>% filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS > 1) %>% kable()
```

Furthermore, the `TRANSACTED_PRICE` for such transactions are **hundred million dollar transactions**, which can skew the data if we are looking at `TRANSACTED_PRICE` with the assumption that it is the **price per unit**.

For example **TXN01567**, is worth **\$392,180,000**, which is much higher that the price of individual units

## 3.5 Handling the bulk transactions

To address the 12 bulk transactions in our dataframe, we have 2 possible options:

-   **Option 1**: Remove these transactions as these correspond to **0.045%** of transactions ([**EASY**]{style="color:green"})

-   **Option 2**: Create rows for each unit in the transaction ([**HARD**]{style="color:red"})

Although Option 2 is more difficult, it is the better approach as all the transactions are **Resale** transactions. Simply removing them may remove very important data for the resale submarket.

For this solution, we need to do the following:

1.  Repeat all rows by `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` times.
2.  Set transacted price to the average price: $\frac{TRANSACTED\_PRICE}{NUMBER\_OF\_UNITS}$.
3.  Set the area (sqft) to the average area: $\frac{AREA\_SQFT}{NUMBER\_OF\_UNITS}$.
4.  Set `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` to 1.

### Repeating rows

Reference: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11121385/repeat-rows-of-a-data-frame)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### Functions used

`rep()` - to repeat a dataframe

`seq_len(nrow())` - to iterate to each row of the dataframe
:::

```{r}
realis_per_unit <- realis[rep(seq_len(nrow(realis)), realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS),]
```

Lets' check if the number of rows correspond to the total number of units sold.

```{r}
nrow(realis_per_unit) == sum(realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS)
```

### Setting column values

We will perform the changes to `NUMBER_OF_UNITS`, `TRANSACTED_PRICE`, `AREA_SQFT` in 1 code chunk so that rerunning the code chunk is idempotent and won't mutate the variable further

```{r}
realis_per_unit <- realis_per_unit %>%
  filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS > 1) %>%
  mutate(TRANSACTED_PRICE = round(TRANSACTED_PRICE / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %>%
  mutate(AREA_SQFT = round(AREA_SQFT / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %>%
  mutate(NUMBER_OF_UNITS = 1) %>%
  rbind(realis_per_unit %>% # Reconnect to the rest of the dataframe
              filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS == 1))
```
:::

Let us verify the result of the transformation.

::: panel-tabset
### Before

```{r}
realis %>%
  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(
    "TXN00001", "TXN00002", # Single-unit transactions
    "TXN10593", "TXN13376" # Bulk transactions
    )) %>% kable()
```

### After

```{r}
realis_per_unit %>%
  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(
    "TXN00001", "TXN00002", # Single-unit transactions
    "TXN10593", "TXN13376" # Bulk transactions
    )) %>% kable()
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Save point

Let us save `realis_per_unit` so we do not need to rerun the steps above.

```{r}
write_rds(realis_per_unit, "data/rds/realis_per_unit.rds")
```

# 4 Data Exploration

For this exercise, we will focus on exploring and visualizing the **distribution among the different submarkets**.

The points of interest are:

-   2023 and 2024 Q1 prices

-   Trends in sales volume per quarter

-   Distribution across different markets within 2024Q1

## 4.1 Comparing 2023Q1 and 2024Q1 prices

First we will compare the prices between the **First Quarter** of 2023 and 2024. This is to compare the prices at the same time of the year.

For this visualization, we will use the **Unit Price per Sqft** (`UNIT_PRICE_PSF`) instead of the **Transaction Price** (`TRANSACTED_PRICE`). This is so we can more fairly compare prices with less variables involved. With Transaction Price, the size of the property needs to be considered.

We will use the `TYPE_OF_SALE` column to partition the data so we can compare the trends across the **Resale, New Sale and Sub Sale markets**.

### 4.1.2 Creating the base Visualization

For the visualization, we will use a **Raincloud Plot** so that we can see the patterns in the price trends, and whether there are clusters of interest within the data set.

We will also add a **boxplot** to accompany the half-density plot so that we can see the quantiles more clearly.

To compare the different quarters, we will use both **left side and right side** visualization to compare the quarters side by side. This is inspired by a [senior's work.](https://akalestale.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01)

To visualize the volumes, the 2 options are using `stat_dots()` or `geom_jitter()`.

::: callout-important
#### Winner: stat_dots()

Using `stat_dots()` is better than `geom_jitter()` as the purpose of providing volume information here is to **accompany the half-density plot** and provide a tool to compare the volume of each submarket.

Comparing the length of each horizontal line is much easier to do than comparing how dark each area is in a jitter plot.
:::

Now that we have the base visualization, we will generate the final visualization.

### 4.1.2 Generating the visualization

We want to compare the 2023 and 2024 Q1 sales for different submarkets. To do this, we will use `facet_wrap()` on `TYPE_OF_SALE`.

In addition, we will add another facet for **All Markets** for the overall comparison.

These 2 plots will be shown side by side using `patchwork`.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### facet_grid(margin = TRUE) as alternative

We can also use `facet_grid(margin = TRUE)` to generate a facet with all the data, instead of generating 2 separate plots.

However, I would like to change the panel color for the overall plot to highlight it but I couldn't find a way to do it within `facet_grid()`.

#### Insights

Although there is an overall slight increase in market unit prices compared to Q1 2023, the **New Sale** market experienced a decrease, with notable groups in the graph. This indicates cluster of sales in certain price points, which may be influenced by factors such as **developer pricing** and **location of New Launches.**

The New Sales Market is composed of **New Launch** properties. Groups are expected to appear in the density map as new projects are expected in new estates, while less projects are expected in mature estates. According to [99.co](https://www.99.co/singapore/new-launches), there are **less than 10 New Launches** in 2024. Prices are set by the developers so there is **less variation in unit price within each project**. Hence, it is expected to see groups around these New Launches. This effect is also observed to a smaller extent in the Sub Sale Market.

In the Resale Market, the available market is **all properties that have already been turned over by developers**. Price is set based on agreement between the buyer and seller, and is not limited to certain projects. Hence, there is more variation in the prices, which is why the distribution appears smoother.
:::

However, it is important to note that visualization can be very **misleading** especially on the New Sale Market. Generalizing that the trends when there are notable cluster may not be representative of the real state of the market.

Hence, we need to look more deeply into these groups and present it as a visualizations so it can be better understood why there are groups that formed.

## 4.2 Comparing 2023Q1 and 2024Q1 Sales Volume

### 4.2.1 Understanding the groups in New Sales Market

We hypothesized that the groups that are present in the **New Sales** plot is due to the sales of **newly-launched projects**.

We will check the aggregated data by `PROJECT_NAME` and `POSTAL_DISTRICT` to verify our hypothesis that the sales are clustered by newly launched projects and their respective districts

::: panel-tabset
#### By Project Name

We will aggregate the **number of sales** and **median unit price** by projects. We will also add `POSTAL_DISTRICT` to the aggregation group as property prices depend on which district a property is in.

```{r}
realis_per_unit %>% filter(TYPE_OF_SALE == "New Sale", QUARTER == "2024Q1") %>% 
  group_by(POSTAL_DISTRICT, PROJECT_NAME) %>%
  summarize(
    MEDIAN_PRICE_PSF = median(UNIT_PRICE_PSF),
    NUMBER_OF_SALES = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(NUMBER_OF_SALES)) %>%
  head(10) %>% kable(row.name = TRUE)
```

We can see that **8 out of 10** projects with highest number of sales are in **Districts 23 and 26.** This is consistent with our previous observation that there are 2 groups in the New Sales density graph.

Furthermore, in [99.co's New Launches page](https://www.99.co/singapore/new-launches), [Lentor Mansion](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lentor-mansion) (D26) and [Lumina Grand](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lumina-grand) (D23) are the biggest projects with the highest number of units sold.

Hence, the density graph could reflected the groups that formed from the sales of properties within these 2 projects.

#### By District

```{r}
realis_per_unit %>% filter(TYPE_OF_SALE == "New Sale", QUARTER == "2024Q1") %>% 
  group_by(POSTAL_DISTRICT) %>%
  summarize(
    MEDIAN_PRICE_PSF = median(UNIT_PRICE_PSF),
    NUMBER_OF_SALES = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(NUMBER_OF_SALES)) %>%
  kable(row.names = TRUE)
```

Although there are new units across all districts, the big, newly launched projects contributed the most to the New Sales Market.

This is hinted by the fact that after aggregating all property sales by district, D23 and D26 where [Lumina Grand](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lumina-grand) and [Lentor Mansion](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lentor-mansion) stand out. More than 60% of sales from each of these district also come from these 2 projects.
:::

Based on the findings from this deep dive, we will visualize the sales volume by district.

### 4.2.2. Creating the base visualization

Some of the options we have to visualize the sales by district are:

-   Bar graph of number of sales for **all** district, or

-   Bar graph of number of sales for **most popular** districts

::: panel-tabset
#### All districts

```{r}
plot_q1_yoy_sale_vol <- function() {
ggplot(
  realis_per_unit %>% filter(QUARTER %in% c("2023Q1", "2024Q1")),
  aes(x = POSTAL_DISTRICT, fill = QUARTER)
) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey45", "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()
}

plot_q1_yoy_sale_vol()
```

#### Most popular districts (chosen)

This visualization needs some pre-processing so we can determine the Top 5 most popular districts in each submarket.

```{r}
popular_districts <- realis_per_unit %>% filter(QUARTER %in% c("2023Q1", "2024Q1")) %>% 
  group_by(QUARTER, POSTAL_DISTRICT, TYPE_OF_SALE) %>%
  summarize(
    MEDIAN_PRICE_PSF = median(UNIT_PRICE_PSF),
    NUMBER_OF_SALES = n()
  ) %>%
  group_by(QUARTER, TYPE_OF_SALE) %>%
  arrange(desc(NUMBER_OF_SALES)) %>%
  mutate(RANK = order(NUMBER_OF_SALES, decreasing=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(RANK <= 5) %>%
  select(c(QUARTER, TYPE_OF_SALE, RANK, POSTAL_DISTRICT, NUMBER_OF_SALES, MEDIAN_PRICE_PSF)) %>%
  arrange(QUARTER)

kable(popular_districts, row.names = TRUE)
```

Now that we have this aggregated dataset, we can use this to plot the ranked data. For example, we can plot the most popular districts in the New Sales Market.

```{r}
ggplot(popular_districts %>% filter(TYPE_OF_SALE =="New Sale"),
       aes(x = reorder(RANK, -RANK), y = NUMBER_OF_SALES, fill = QUARTER))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE, alpha =0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(y = 10, hjust=0, label=paste0("D", POSTAL_DISTRICT, ": ", NUMBER_OF_SALES))) +
  coord_flip(ylim= c(0, 600)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey45", "blue")) +
  facet_wrap(~QUARTER)
```

With this visualization, we can compare the top districts from 2 quarters side by side.
:::

From the 2 options, plotting the **Most Popular Districts** is more appropriate for our use case. This is because we would like the user to recognize which districts are driving the price trends.

When we plot all the districts, it is more difficult to identify by sight which districts are popular in a quarter and the other. This is because this plot has a lot of noise, which may not be that relevant to connect to the previous visualization.

#### Insights

Plotting the most popular districts for each submarket reveals that the Top 5 districts in the **New Sale** market, differs for the 2 quarters.

In 2023Q1, the distribution is more balanced and there were a lot of units sold in expensive districts like **Districts 9** and **10**. However, In 2024Q1, the number of units sold were skewed towards cheaper districts like **Districts 23** and **26** where big projects like [Lumina Grand](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lumina-grand) and [Lentor Mansion](https://www.99.co/singapore/condos-apartments/lentor-mansion), respectively, were launched.

This is why the overall prices in the New Sale market appear to be much cheaper than the previous year, when in fact the new projects that launched are in **cheaper districts**.

On the contrary, the top districts in the Resale and Sub Sale markets have much less difference. This smaller change also resulted in a smaller impact on the overall median price in these markets.
