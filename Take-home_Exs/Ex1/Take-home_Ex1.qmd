## 1.1 Problem Statement

## 1.2 The Data

For this exercise, we will use the residential real estate transaction data from [REALIS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/index). This provides comprehensive and up-to-date statistics on the property market in Singapore.

The dataset has been provided via eLearn and added to the `data/` folder of this exercise.

## 1.3 Methodology

# 2 Setup

## 2.1 Loading the R packages

For this exercise, we will mainly use the following packages:

-   tidyverse:

Aside from these, we will also include other packages that will help us present the data better.

-   [knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.45): used for dynamic report generation in R. For this exercise, we will use this package to render our tables better.

```{r}
#| label: setup
pacman::p_load(knitr, tidyverse)
```

## 2.2 Import the datasets

First, we need to import the provided datasets. We will use `read_csv()` for each csv file to do this.

### Issues with column names

Some of the column names have special characters that affect the data import.

For example, if we read one of the files without any revisions, it results into the following:

```{r}
read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv') %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

As shown above, the headers for `Transacted Price ($)`,`Area (SQFT)`, `UnitPrice(PSF)` have merged and the `$` did not render properly.

To prevent this, we will rename `$` in the column names to `SGD` using `rename()` function.
