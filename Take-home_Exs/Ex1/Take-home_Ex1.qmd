# 1 Overview

## 1.1 Background

Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world at 89.7%, [2nd only to Russia among the G20](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/home-ownership-rate?continent=g20) countries. Due to Singapore's successful public housing program, [77.8% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats](13+%20Housing%20&%20Household%20Statistics%20in%20Singapore%20(2024)), while 22% live in private properties like condos or landed properties.

While the HDB market targets Singaporeans with household income of up to 14,000 SGD, the private housing market is Singapore is still in demand for households looking to upgrade, invest their property, and for residents not eligible for public housing (e.g. high income household, foreigners, etc.)

In this exercise we will look at the market trends for private residential property market for 2024 Q1 and see how the economic factors have affected it.

## 1.2 Loading the data sources

For this exercise, we will use the residential real estate transaction data from [REALIS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/index). This provides comprehensive and up-to-date statistics on the private property market in Singapore.

The dataset has been provided via eLearn and added to the `data/` folder of this exercise.

### File Structure

![](images/file_structure.png)
:::

For the purposes of this exercise, we will refer to each data as the following:

-   **2023Q1**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv`

-   **2023Q2**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv`

-   **2023Q3**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv`

-   **2023Q4**: `ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv`

-   **2024Q1**: `ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv`

## 1.3 Methodology

To start the data analysis, we first need to prepare the R environment for analysis. This includes loading the R packages and loading the datasets.

After the setup, we need to do data wrangling where we clean and transform the data into a form that is fitting for our analysis. This will possible entail removing irrelevant data, deriving additional variables, renaming columns, etc.

Next, we need to decide on what data we would like to look at closely. For the purposes of this exercise, these are the data we can look at that can potentially give valuable insights:

-   Total units sold by quarter

-   Units sold by submarkets such as property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.

-   Transaction price by submarkets such property type (e.g. landed, strata), sale type (e.g. resale, new sale, subsale), etc.

Finally, we will do data exploration and visualize the insights gained from the data. Some of the questions we would ask are:

-   What is the general quarterly trend of private residential property sales prices?

-   Is this trend consistent among all submarkets?

-   How affordable are private residential properties for Singaporean households?

# 2 Setup

## 2.1 Loading the R packages

For this exercise, we will mainly use the following packages:

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): collection of R packages used in data science, which includes [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), among others

Aside from these, we will also include other packages that will help us present the data better.

-   [knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.45): used for dynamic report generation in R. For this exercise, we will use this package to render our tables better.

```{r}
#| label: setup
pacman::p_load(ggthemes, hrbrthemes, knitr, tidyverse, patchwork, ggdist)
```

## 2.2 Data Checkpoints

As the analysis is expected to have a lot of intermediate steps, **Save**, **Load**, and **Data clear** points are available to make our data wrangling more efficient.

::: callout-tip
### Save point

This is where data is written as `rds` files using `write_rds()` for important data sets that will be used in later analysis. Examples are:

-   Data we need to prepare for analysis
-   Critical outputs of expensive calculations
-   Cleaned up data for lightweight processing
:::

::: callout-note
### Load point

This is where data is loaded from `rds` files using `read_rds()`. They were previously generated by the save point.

**TIP**: Skip to the load points to progress without running the code above it
:::

::: callout-warning
### Data clear point

This is where data that will not be used anymore are cleared. The data in RStudio environment will pile up and will make it more difficult to check the relevant data in each part.

We can set `#| eval: false` in code chunks if we want skip the clearing. For example, the code below won't be run.

```{r}
#| eval: false
message <- "This code chunk executed"
```
:::

To use these checkpoints, we need to create `data/rds` folder.

# 3 Data Wrangling

## 3.1 Importing the datasets

Upon inspection of the csv files, column names have human-readable titles such as "Project Name", "Transacted Price (\$)", etc. While good for humans, these column names may cause parsing issues with R, especially as there are special characters.

Because of this, we will rename the columns in their UPPER_CASE format after removing the special characters. We will create a helper function that will help us accomplish this:

```{r}
rename_realis_column <- function(orig_name) {
  # Add underscores to spaces
  gsub(" +", "_",
       # Remove special characters
       gsub("[^A-Z ]", "",
            # Convert to upper case and remove trailing spaces
            toupper(orig_name)) %>% trimws())
}
```

We will use `read_csv()` to import each file and use `rename_realis_column()` in the `rename_with()` function.

::: panel-tabset
### 2023 Q1

```{r}
realis_2023q1 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q1, n=7))
```

There are **4,722** private residential propertysales for 2023 Q1.

### 2023 Q2

```{r}
realis_2023q2 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q2, n=7))
```

There are **6,125** private residential property sales for 2023 Q2.

### 2023 Q3

```{r}
realis_2023q3 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q3, n=7))
```

There are **6,206** private residential property sales for 2023 Q3.

### 2023 Q4

```{r}
realis_2023q4 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2023q4, n=7))
```

There are **4,851** private residential property sales for 2023 Q4.

### 2024 Q1

```{r}
realis_2024q1 <- read_csv('data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv') %>%
                  rename_with(rename_realis_column)
kable(head(realis_2024q1, n=7))
```

There are **4,902** private residential property sales for 2024 Q1.
:::

```{r}
glimpse(realis_2023q1)
```

The imported dataset has 21 variables.

## 3.2 Combining the dataframes

Next, we will combine all 5 `realis_202*q*` dataframes into a single one to simplify aggregation and partitioning of data for analysis.

This will also simplify cleanup and transformation as they will be done on a single dataframe instead of 5.

To do this, we need to add `QUARTER` values to each dataframe before merging them to a single one. We will use the format `<YEAR>Q<QUARTER>`, i.e `2024Q1` for 2024 Q1. This is so we can identify which quarter the sale was made, which we will use for aggregation.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
### Functions used

-   `mutate()` for adding new column

-   `rbind()` for combining all dataframes

-   `seq_len()` and `nrow()` for generating a sequence of IDs

-   `sprintf()` for formatting a string.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Adding QUARTER column

```{r}
realis_2023q1 <- mutate(realis_2023q1, QUARTER="2023Q1")
realis_2023q2 <- mutate(realis_2023q2, QUARTER="2023Q2")
realis_2023q3 <- mutate(realis_2023q3, QUARTER="2023Q3")
realis_2023q4 <- mutate(realis_2023q4, QUARTER="2023Q4")
realis_2024q1 <- mutate(realis_2024q1, QUARTER="2024Q1")
```

### Combining data frames

```{r}
realis <- realis_2023q1 %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q2) %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q3) %>%
  rbind(realis_2023q4) %>%
  rbind(realis_2024q1)
kable(head(realis, n=10))
```

### Adding transaction ID's (TXN_ID)

We will also add `TXN_ID` so we can more easily refer to the observations later on. The format is `TXN00000`.

```{r}
realis$TXN_ID <- sprintf("TXN%05d", seq_len(nrow(realis)))
```

### Verifying the result

Let us check if all rows are accounted for by checking if the number of rows in `realis` is the total number of rows from all dataframes.

```{r}
nrow(realis) == nrow(realis_2023q1) +
  nrow(realis_2023q2) +
  nrow(realis_2023q3) +
  nrow(realis_2023q4) +
  nrow(realis_2024q1)
```

## 3.3 Filtering relevant columns

After adding the `QUARTER` and `TXN_ID` columns, there are now 23 variables in the dataframe. However, not all of them are relevant to answer the questions we are asking. The table below summarizes the columns and whether we will keep them or not.

### Filter code

We will now use `select()` to keep only the relevant columns. We will define the function below for filtering the relevant columns. This will also rearrange the columns based on the order in the function call.

```{r}
realis <-
  realis %>% select(
    c(
      TXN_ID,
      QUARTER,
      NUMBER_OF_UNITS,
      TRANSACTED_PRICE,
      AREA_SQFT,
      TYPE_OF_SALE,
      PROPERTY_TYPE,
      TYPE_OF_AREA,
      POSTAL_DISTRICT,
      PLANNING_REGION,
      PLANNING_AREA,
      TENURE,
      UNIT_PRICE_PSF,
      COMPLETION_DATE,
      PURCHASER_ADDRESS_INDICATOR
    )
  )
```
:::

After this initial cleanup, we are left with 15 variables relevant to our exploration.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Save point

Let us save `realis` so we do not need to rerun the steps above.

```{r}
write_rds(realis, "data/rds/realis_after_clean.rds")
```
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
### Data clear point

We do not need the `realis_202*q*` dataframes anymore so we can remove them from the RStudio environment.

```{r}
#| eval: true
rm(realis_2023q1)
rm(realis_2023q2)
rm(realis_2023q3)
rm(realis_2023q4)
rm(realis_2024q1)
```
:::

## 3.4 Closer look at NUMBER_OF_UNITS

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Load point

We can continue running the document from this point by loading the following prepared data.

```{r}
realis <- read_rds("data/rds/realis_after_clean.rds")
```
:::

Taking a closer look at `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` columns reveals that **12 out of 26,806 transactions** involve multiple units.

```{r}
realis[order(-realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS),] %>% filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS > 1) %>% kable()
```

Furthermore, the `TRANSACTED_PRICE` for such transactions are **hundred million dollar transactions**, which can skew the data if we are looking at `TRANSACTED_PRICE` with the assumption that it is the **price per unit**.

For example **TXN01567**, is worth **\$392,180,000**, which is much higher that the price of individual units

## 3.5 Handling the bulk transactions

To address the 12 bulk transactions in our dataframe, we have 2 possible options:

-   **Option 1**: Remove these transactions as these correspond to **0.045%** of transactions ([**EASY**]{style="color:green"})

-   **Option 2**: Create rows for each unit in the transaction ([**HARD**]{style="color:red"})

Although Option 2 is more difficult, it is the better approach as all the transactions are **Resale** transactions. Simply removing them may remove very important data for the resale submarket.

For this solution, we need to do the following:

1.  Repeat all rows by `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` times.
2.  Set transacted price to the average price: $\frac{TRANSACTED\_PRICE}{NUMBER\_OF\_UNITS}$.
3.  Set the area (sqft) to the average area: $\frac{AREA\_SQFT}{NUMBER\_OF\_UNITS}$.
4.  Set `NUMBER_OF_UNITS` to 1.

### Repeating rows

Reference: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11121385/repeat-rows-of-a-data-frame)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### Functions used

`rep()` - to repeat a dataframe

`seq_len(nrow())` - to iterate to each row of the dataframe
:::

```{r}
realis_per_unit <- realis[rep(seq_len(nrow(realis)), realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS),]
```

Lets' check if the number of rows correspond to the total number of units sold.

```{r}
nrow(realis_per_unit) == sum(realis$NUMBER_OF_UNITS)
```

### Setting column values

We will perform the changes to `NUMBER_OF_UNITS`, `TRANSACTED_PRICE`, `AREA_SQFT` in 1 code chunk so that rerunning the code chunk is idempotent and won't mutate the variable further

```{r}
realis_per_unit <- realis_per_unit %>%
  filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS > 1) %>%
  mutate(TRANSACTED_PRICE = round(TRANSACTED_PRICE / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %>%
  mutate(AREA_SQFT = round(AREA_SQFT / NUMBER_OF_UNITS, 0)) %>%
  mutate(NUMBER_OF_UNITS = 1) %>%
  rbind(realis_per_unit %>% # Reconnect to the rest of the dataframe
              filter(NUMBER_OF_UNITS == 1))
```
:::

Let us verify the result of the transformation.

::: panel-tabset
### Before

```{r}
realis %>%
  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(
    "TXN00001", "TXN00002", # Single-unit transactions
    "TXN10593", "TXN13376" # Bulk transactions
    )) %>% kable()
```

### After

```{r}
realis_per_unit %>%
  filter(TXN_ID %in% c(
    "TXN00001", "TXN00002", # Single-unit transactions
    "TXN10593", "TXN13376" # Bulk transactions
    )) %>% kable()
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Save point

Let us save `realis_per_unit` so we do not need to rerun the steps above.

```{r}
write_rds(realis_per_unit, "data/rds/realis_per_unit.rds")
```
